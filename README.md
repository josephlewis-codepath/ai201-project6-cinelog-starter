# CineLog

A community film tracking app. Users log films they've watched, rate them, and build collections.

This repository is the starting point for **Project 6: Simulated Code Review**.

---

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python seed.py
python app.py
```

The app starts on `http://localhost:5000` and uses a local SQLite database (`cinelog.db`). `seed.py` loads a demo user and a few films so the endpoints have data to return.

## Your Task

You're working on the `feature/watchlist` branch, which adds a watchlist feature to CineLog. A maintainer (`@dev-lead`) has reviewed your PR and left six comments. Your job is to address all six.

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before touching any code. Then check out the `feature/watchlist` branch:

```bash
git checkout feature/watchlist
```

The open PR and the maintainer's review comments are filed on GitHub. Work through each comment and document your responses in your **PR Response Doc**.
